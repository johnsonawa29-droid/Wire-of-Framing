# wireframe is like a blueprint for a website or app.

Just like an architect sketches the layout of a house before building it, designers use wireframes to show the basic structure of a website or app before adding colors, images, or detailed design.

It’s usually made of simple boxes, lines, and labels to show where things like the menu, buttons, pictures, and text will go. 


# The importance of wireframes in the design process is that they act as a foundation and guide before jumping into detailed design or coding. Here are the key reasons why they’re important:

* Clarifies ideas early – Wireframes help turn rough ideas into a visible layout, so everyone understands the structure.

* Saves time and cost – It’s much easier (and cheaper) to fix problems in a simple sketch than after coding or full design.

* Improves communication – Designers, developers, and clients can all “see” the plan and give feedback before moving forward.

* 
Acts as a blueprint – Just like a building plan, it guides the next steps: visual design, content creation, and development.
